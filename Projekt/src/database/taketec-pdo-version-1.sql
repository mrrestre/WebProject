Among what they found, firstly, is a handful of new details on upcoming camera features.\r\nNew Camera Features\r\nIf you’ll recall last year, several new camera modes likely arriving on the Galaxy S11/S20 were discovered. One of those new modes was “Director’s View” and this latest teardown digs into that a bit further. Strings suggest that this camera mode will allow users to lock in on a subject and the phone will keep that subject in focus as well as getting close-up shots of the subject.\r\n\r\nFurther, another new camera is found in this latest teardown called “Single Take Photo.” With this mode, Samsung uses AI to automatically capture the best shots. Google does this to an extent with features such as Photobooth on the Pixel, but Samsung seems to be expanding things with tips for framing shots or different angles.\r\n\r\nFinally, rounding things out, there’s evidence that Samsung is bringing back a “Pro Video” mode. This would allow users to adjust shutter speed, ISO, exposure, and more in video just like Galaxy devices can currently do with photos.

At CES 2020 this week, we got a chance to spend some time with the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet, a Chrome OS tablet that ticks pretty much all of the boxes.\r\n\r\nSo, what’s been the problem with Chrome OS tablets so far? To date, only two Chrome OS tablets have launched, and, frankly, neither of them have been very good. That’s Google’s Pixel Slate, which was a monumental failure that saw the company pull out of tablets entirely, and the Acer Chromebook Tab 10, an education-focused machine.

Firstly, that users should be allowed to fully delete any pre-installed app on their device. Secondly, these pre-installed apps should “adhere to the same scrutiny as Play Store apps.” Finally, pre-installed apps should have “some update mechanism” that doesn’t require an account and that Google should refuse to certify devices with privacy concerns.', 'https://ww.9to5google.com/2020/01/11/android-bloatware-privacy-open-letter/', 0, '0.00', 'Google Against Android Bloatware', 'Google pushed to take action against Android bloatware by 50+ organizations', 0),

There’s no shortage of options out there, but one that many Android users have gravitated toward has been Samsung’s Galaxy Buds, and now, they’ve got a second generation.\r\n\r\nI never had a chance to use the original Galaxy Buds, unfortunately, but I’ve been able to try quite a few pairs of truly wireless earbuds in the past several months. After a few days of testing out the Galaxy Buds+ pretty extensively, I’m surprised at how much I like them. I don’t think they’re the right answer for everyone, but there’s a lot to love with the Galaxy Buds+, especially if you’re a Spotify user. Here’s the good and the bad.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Buds+: The Good\r\nWorks great with Android, even better with Samsung\r\nFirst, let’s talk about the main reason you’re probably interested in these earbuds — they work with Android. Pretty much every pair of truly wireless earbuds work with Android in one way or another, even Apple’s AirPods. However, a lot of them lack extra functions on the platform.\r\n\r\nWith the Samsung Galaxy Buds+, there’s no shortage of extra functionality. On a Samsung smartphone, just pair and you’ll be greeted with a pop-up that shows the battery status of each bud and the case, too. It’s a direct clone of what Apple shows with AirPods, but that’s not really a bad thing!\r\nUnfortunately, those bonuses aren’t available on all Android phones. My testing was paired to a Pixel 4 XL, which meant I had to download extra apps. More on that later, but once the apps are installed, you’ll have control over the Buds+ to customize taps and the like. The only thing you won’t get is the pop-up with battery details. That’s held within the app only.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Buds+: The Bad\r\nPoor default sound profile\r\nIf you’re not a Samsung user, there’s one big negative to the Galaxy Buds+. The default sound profile is legitimately awful. When I first paired these and listened to them, I wondered if there was some plastic still on, then realizing there wasn’t, I just assumed they were worse than I’d heard.\r\n\r\nThis review would have had a very different outcome had that sound profile been what these always sound like. Upon downloading the Samsung Gear app, you can switch the Buds+ to “Dynamic” mode, which sounds a whole lot better. I’d still rank Jabra’s Elite 75t above the Buds+, but with Dynamic mode, they’re pretty decent.', 'https://9to5google.com/2020/02/20/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review/', 1, '2.99', 'Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Review', 'The new Galaxy Buds+: Come for Android compatibility, stay for Spotify', 0),

Now, a product listing might be revealing that information and it’s not too far off.\r\n\r\nWhen the Galaxy Chromebook was announced, Samsung only said that it would be coming out sometime in Q1 of this year. That’s definitely soon, but it’s not quite enough of an exact timeline to help customers put aside the cash needed to buy it.\r\n\r\nAboutChromebooks spotted a product listing from Best Buy — since removed — which mentions an April 6 release date for the Galaxy Chromebook. Of course, that’s definitely subject to change, but it’s the first mention we’ve heard of a release date for the product outside of Samsung’s vague timeline. That date makes sense, too, as it gives Samsung a bit of time to cool off following the Galaxy S20/Z Flip launch.\r\n\r\nAlso of interest, an LTE model was spotted on Samsung’s own website. Samsung didn’t announce this previously, but it’d be an appreciated option for Chrome OS users. As it stands today, there are very few Chromebooks with LTE connectivity, Samsung’s Chromebook Plus v2 being one of the only ones that comes to mind.\r\n\r\nIf that is actually happening, though, Samsung would have to create another variant of the machine, possibly running on a different chip.

Now, I spend more time at a pretty powerful desktop rig than not, so my priorities have shifted drastically.\r\n\r\nThe three biggest draws for me with the Surface Pro X were LTE connectivity, portability, and battery life.

Apple’s market share fell slightly to 41% QoQ as it attempted to keep up with swift overall market growth; market share for the full year reached 47% […]\r\n\r\nXiaomi kept its second-place spot in the quarter supported by strong sales of its Redmi Airdots, followed by Samsung, QCY and JLab. The race for second intensified, with both Xiaomi and Samsung holding around 6% unit market share for the year.\r\n\r\nThe market as a whole grew significantly in the final quarter of the year.\r\n\r\nThe global market size for true wireless hearables beat expectations, growing 53% QoQ in 4Q19, topping 51m units for the quarter and 130m units for the full year, according to Counterpoint Research’s latest Hearables Market Tracker. The US was the main driver for the quarter, growing 76% QoQ and accounting for 35% of the global market on the back of seasonal promotions and Apple’s new model launch.\r\n\r\nCounterpoint expects AirPods sales to top 100M this year, and says that while Samsung is targeting a distant second place, it may struggle to achieve this.\r\n\r\n“We expect Apple to sell more than 100m true wireless hearables in 2020, including AirPods Pros, to maintain their comfortable lead in the market,” said Liz Lee, Senior Analyst at Counterpoint Research. “The real competition will be for second place, especially in the premium market; Samsung, which sold 8m Galaxy Buds last year, will need further upgrades to those expected in the Galaxy Buds Plus, including noise cancellation and other advanced features and designs, in order to beat its rivals.”\r\n\r\nThere may be a temporary dent in AirPods sales this quarter.
